#1515 Genes associated with Neurodegeneration, dowloaded from DisGenNET (07.02.22)
#Downloaded as .TSV file, imported into Excel > saved as .csv file 
#Columns retained: "Gene", "Gene_id", "Score_gda". 
#Column added: "ND" with "Y" for identifier/subset upon merge with the interactor list in rStudio.

#The following script imports the list of genes associated with neurodegeneration, retains columns: "Gene_id", "Score_gda", "ND".
